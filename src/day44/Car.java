// In Java, we can achieve abstraction:
// 1. with abstract classes
// 2. with interfaces

// Abstraction is when we focus on what object does instead of
// how it does. We create abstract structure with abstract methods.
// And then when concrete class implements our abstraction it
// must implement (Override) all abstract methods.
// - we cannot create object out of abstract class directly
// - abstraction becomes useful when we have concrete classes.
//   Concrete class is non-abstract class that extends abstract class
//   or interface.
// - The concrete classes must implement all abstract methods from abstraction.
//   Implement means override.
